Added Hit Deposit mode to storage sack: Hit on a block to change modes, and hit on a container to deposit (if you have enabled it).  Add smelting recipes for End & Nether ores by request in case you silk touch them.

Fix keybindings for Extended Inventory and Inventory Crafting not closing the screens when open.  Add chat message to ender dungeon finder if no spawners are in range.  Fix Ender Book crashing servers when players used it and didn't have enough experience points."

Also no longer uncrafts enchanted items, or unenchanted items using a recipe that creates an enchanted one (Fixes the progressive automation/nether star exploit);  recipe slightly changed, 3 obsidian instead of 1;  Harvester: processing time now in config file.  Nether and End ores now have correct mining levels set (so no longer can you mine nether diamond ore with a wooden pickaxe for example).  Auto fisher now respects mending enchantment to repair fishing rods with fished exp (it already worked with luck and unbreaking and others before).  Autofisher now runs every second instead of every tick (default speed is still the same at 7% chance to catch).  Autofisher speed in config file."

Ender carrots now increase horse jump height by 1% each, down from 2%.  Magic Bean now grows with bonemeal.  Add config option in items category for saddles horse armor, and records to stack to 16.  "
  	,"1.8.3":"Harvester and Block Miner now have a GUI screen.  All cyclic machines that required redstone now have a redstone toggle button in their GUI: This allows you to change between two modes: Always On and Requires redstone.  Increased mining efficiency of Block Miner.  Removed the recently added stacksize 16 for records: Vanilla jukeboxes are buggy and can't handle this, causes item duplication."

ProspectorRange now has default config value of 32 instead of 16 (doesn't affect existing config files).

Fix Piston Scepter letting the offhand action trigger at the same time.   "
 	,"1.8.14":"Magic Bean: Now has config file entries to disable bonemeal, and disable dropping a bean (seed item) when fully grown.  Magic Bean loot table is now entirely in the config file (so you can remove items or add modded items).  New category mobs -> mobloottable so you can tweak the bonus item drop percentage on top of just the true/false.  The chance for cyclic items to spawn in dungeon chests is now in config as ChestLootChance and defaults to 4 (it used to be hardcoded as 7; still can be disabled by ChestLoot config as normal).  Removed Emerald Shovel and Axe from dungeon loot.  All Ender Projectiles now work out of a dispenser (Snow, Bombs, Blaze, Dungeon Finder, Fishing, Lightning, Torch, Water, Shears).

Automatic Fishing Net and Pattern Replicator no longer burn as furnace fuel.  New Blocks: slime conveyors now come in four total variants: fast, normal, slow, slowest.   Slime conveyors: now take up full space of the block (like a carpet) instead of partial (like a pressure plate) so entities dont have inconsistent speed at edges of a block.  Slime conveyors now keep the entity 'grounded' so they dont get sudden bursts of speed when going down a block onto a conveyor on a lower level(as seen in xisumavoids video with the sheep. can be reverted to old behavior in config->SlimeConveyorKeepEntityGrounded).  Slime conveyors now have an autocorrect feature that keep moving entities in the center of the path (can be disabled in config->blocks->SlimeConveyorPullCenter)"
  	,"1.9.11":"Add block highlight overlay to Exchange scepters.  Fix Exchange scepter breaking blocks that are unbreakable.  Add blacklist to exchange scepter, default starts with only obsidian (modded blocks are supported).  Made some mild nerfs to both Exchange Scepters (reasoning: meant to be building & decorating, not be overpowered mining tools): Durability from 5000 to 1000 uses; takes damage per block replaced not per use (so a 3x3 area will take away 9 durability from item); cooldown from 10 ticks to 30 ticks; and upped recipe cost.  Fix slowfall potion from Wing charm getting stuck at 0:00.  Accepted a submission to update zh_CH.lang.  "

Scaffolding block changes: renamed to Fragile Scaffolding, slowed down rate of decay, and recipe output increased.  New Block: Reactive Scaffolding that auto breaks when its neighbour breaks.  New Block: Replaceable Scaffolding: building on it replaces it instead of normal placement.  Reduced sound of scaffolding blocks.  Scaffolding blocks are climb-able like a ladder.  Scaffolding blocks can be built at long range: build while sneaking and it builds a block on the far opposite side, so you can easily build bridges or towers.  Fixed scaffolding transparency (it no longer kills grass).  "
